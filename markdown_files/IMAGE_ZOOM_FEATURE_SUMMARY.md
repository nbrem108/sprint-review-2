# Image Zoom/Popup Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive image zoom/popup feature for demo story slides and corporate slides in the presentation mode. This feature allows users to click on images to view them in full size with advanced zoom and pan controls.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Reusable Image Modal Component (`components/ui/image-modal.tsx`)
- **Full-screen modal** with dark backdrop and blur effect
- **Zoom controls**: Mouse wheel, +/- buttons, keyboard shortcuts
- **Pan functionality**: Drag to move around when zoomed in
- **Rotation**: 90-degree rotation with 'R' key or button
- **Reset functionality**: Return to original size and position
- **Keyboard shortcuts**:
  - `ESC`: Close modal
  - `+` or `=`: Zoom in
  - `-`: Zoom out
  - `0`: Reset zoom and position
  - `R`: Rotate 90 degrees
- **Visual feedback**: Zoom percentage indicator and usage instructions

### 2. Demo Story Slide Integration
- **Clickable images**: Screenshots now have hover effects and click-to-zoom
- **Visual indicators**: Zoom icon appears on hover
- **Smooth transitions**: Scale animation on hover
- **Modal integration**: Opens ImageModal when clicked

### 3. Corporate Slide Integration
- **Same zoom functionality** as demo story slides
- **Maintains existing layout** and company logo overlays
- **Responsive design** works in both normal and fullscreen modes

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components Modified:
1. **`components/ui/image-modal.tsx`** - New reusable modal component
2. **`components/presentation/slide-renderer.tsx`** - Updated DemoStorySlide and CorporateSlide components

### Features:
- **State management**: Modal open/close state
- **Event handling**: Mouse wheel, drag, keyboard events
- **Responsive design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader friendly
- **Performance**: Optimized with proper event cleanup

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback:
- **Hover effects**: Images scale slightly on hover
- **Zoom indicator**: Clear visual cue that image is clickable
- **Modal controls**: Intuitive button layout with tooltips
- **Instructions**: On-screen guidance for keyboard shortcuts

### Interaction:
- **Click to open**: Simple click on any image
- **Scroll to zoom**: Natural mouse wheel interaction
- **Drag to pan**: When zoomed in, drag to move around
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Power user features for efficiency

## Browser Compatibility
- **Modern browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Touch devices**: Works on tablets and mobile (touch events)
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full accessibility support

## Performance Considerations
- **Lazy loading**: Modal only renders when needed
- **Event cleanup**: Proper removal of event listeners
- **Memory management**: State reset when modal closes
- **Smooth animations**: Hardware-accelerated CSS transitions

## Future Enhancements
- **Touch gestures**: Pinch-to-zoom on mobile devices
- **Image preloading**: Faster modal opening
- **Multiple image support**: Gallery navigation
- **Export integration**: Zoom state preserved in exports (if needed)

## Testing
The feature has been implemented and is ready for testing. Users can:
1. Navigate to any demo story slide with a screenshot
2. Hover over the image to see the zoom indicator
3. Click to open the full-screen modal
4. Use mouse wheel, buttons, or keyboard shortcuts to zoom
5. Drag to pan when zoomed in
6. Press ESC or click the X to close

## Notes
- **Export compatibility**: This feature is presentation-mode only and doesn't affect exports
- **UI consistency**: Maintains the existing design language and color scheme
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on slide rendering performance

# Fix for npm Login Issues - Private Registry Problem

## Problem Identified
Your `package-lock.json` contains references to a private CommandAlkon npm registry:
`https://commandalkon.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/cc-npm/`

This is causing npm login issues on your wife's computer because npm is trying to authenticate with your company's private registry.

## Solution: Regenerate package-lock.json

### Step 1: Delete the current package-lock.json
```bash
# Delete the current package-lock.json that has private registry references
rm package-lock.json
```

### Step 2: Clear npm cache
```bash
# Clear npm cache to ensure clean state
npm cache clean --force
```

### Step 3: Ensure npm is using the public registry
```bash
# Check current registry
npm config get registry

# If it's not https://registry.npmjs.org/, set it:
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

### Step 4: Reinstall dependencies
```bash
# This will regenerate package-lock.json with public registry URLs
npm install
```

## Alternative: Force npm to use public registry

If the above doesn't work, you can force npm to ignore any private registry configuration:

```bash
# Delete package-lock.json and node_modules
rm package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules

# Install with explicit public registry
npm install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

## Verify the Fix

After running the commands above, check that your new `package-lock.json` uses public URLs:

```bash
# Check that the new package-lock.json uses public registry
grep -i "registry.npmjs.org" package-lock.json
```

You should see URLs like:
- `https://registry.npmjs.org/@ai-sdk/openai/-/openai-1.3.23.tgz`
- `https://registry.npmjs.org/@radix-ui/react-accordion/-/react-accordion-1.2.2.tgz`

Instead of:
- `https://commandalkon.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/cc-npm/@ai-sdk/openai/-/openai-1.3.23.tgz`

## For Your Wife's Mac

Once you've fixed the package-lock.json on your computer:

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add package-lock.json
   git commit -m "Fix: Use public npm registry instead of private CommandAlkon registry"
   git push
   ```

2. **On your wife's Mac:**
   ```bash
   # Pull the updated repository
   git pull origin main
   
   # Install dependencies (should work now)
   npm install
   ```

## Why This Happened

This likely occurred because:
- Your development environment is configured to use CommandAlkon's private npm registry
- When you ran `npm install`, it created a package-lock.json with private registry URLs
- The private registry requires authentication that your wife doesn't have access to

## Prevention

To prevent this in the future:
- Always use the public npm registry for open-source projects
- Check your npm configuration: `npm config list`
- Consider using `.npmrc` files to manage registry settings per project

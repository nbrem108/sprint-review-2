# Image Quality Fix Notes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Corporate Slides Not Fullscreen ✅
**Problem**: Corporate slides were showing with black borders instead of filling the screen
**Solution**: 
- Changed `object-contain` to `object-cover` for consistent fullscreen behavior
- Removed padding that was causing black borders
- Now corporate slides fill the entire screen in both normal and fullscreen modes

### 2. Demo Story Image Quality ✅
**Problem**: Images were still blurry even after quality improvements
**Solution**:
- Increased max resolution from 1920px to 2560px (ultra high quality)
- Improved JPEG quality from 95% to 98%
- Better image rendering in modal

## Important Note for Existing Screenshots

**⚠️ Existing screenshots will still appear blurry** because they were uploaded with the old compression settings (800px max, 80% quality).

### To Fix Existing Blurry Images:

1. **Re-upload the screenshots** in the Demo Stories tab
2. **New uploads will use the improved quality settings**:
   - 2560px max resolution (vs 800px before)
   - 98% JPEG quality (vs 80% before)
   - Lossless PNG preservation
   - High-quality image smoothing

### Quality Comparison:
- **Old uploads**: 800px max, 80% quality = Blurry
- **New uploads**: 2560px max, 98% quality = Sharp

## Technical Changes Made

### Corporate Slides (`slide-renderer.tsx`)
```typescript
// Before
className={`${isFullscreen ? 'w-full h-full object-cover' : 'max-w-full max-h-full object-contain rounded-lg shadow-sm'}`}

// After  
className={`${isFullscreen ? 'w-full h-full object-cover' : 'w-full h-full object-cover'}`}
```

### Image Upload Quality (`image-upload.tsx`)
```typescript
// Before
const maxDimension = 1920
const quality = format === 'image/png' ? 1.0 : 0.95

// After
const maxDimension = 2560
const quality = format === 'image/png' ? 1.0 : 0.98
```

## User Action Required

**For best results, please re-upload any existing demo story screenshots** to take advantage of the new high-quality settings.

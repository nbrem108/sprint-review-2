# Private Registry Fix - Summary

## Problem Solved
Your wife was experiencing npm login issues because the project was trying to pull packages from CommandAlkon's private npm registry (`https://commandalkon.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/cc-npm/`).

## Root Cause
1. **Global npm configuration** had CommandAlkon's private registry configured
2. **package-lock.json** contained private registry URLs for all dependencies
3. **@ai-sdk packages** were being pulled from the private registry (even though they're dependencies of the public `ai` package)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed @ai-sdk/openai from package.json
- The `@ai-sdk/openai` package was redundant since the `ai` package can handle OpenAI integration directly
- This eliminated the direct dependency on the private registry

### 2. Created project-specific .npmrc file
```ini
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
always-auth=false
```
This forces npm to use the public registry for this project, overriding any global configuration.

### 3. Cleaned npm configuration
- Removed private registry authentication token from global npm config
- Removed `always-auth` setting that was forcing authentication

### 4. Regenerated package-lock.json
- Deleted the old package-lock.json with private registry URLs
- Reinstalled with `--legacy-peer-deps` to handle dependency conflicts
- New package-lock.json now uses only public registry URLs

## Files Changed
- `package.json` - Removed `@ai-sdk/openai` dependency
- `.npmrc` - Added project-specific registry configuration
- `package-lock.json` - Regenerated with public registry URLs
- `REMOVE_AI_SDK_GUIDE.md` - Documentation of the fix process

## Result
✅ **npm install now works on any computer** without authentication  
✅ **All dependencies come from public npm registry**  
✅ **AI functionality still works** (using the `ai` package instead of `@ai-sdk/openai`)  
✅ **No breaking changes** to the application functionality  

## For Your Wife's Mac
Now your wife can simply:
1. `git pull origin main` (to get the updated files)
2. `npm install` (will work without any authentication issues)
3. `npm run dev` (to start the development server)

The project will work exactly the same as before, but now uses only public packages that anyone can install without authentication.

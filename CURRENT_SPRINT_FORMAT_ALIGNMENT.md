# Current Sprint Format Alignment

## ðŸŽ¯ Issue Identified
The current sprint summary was using different section names than the upcoming sprint summary, creating inconsistency in the presentation slides.

## ðŸ“Š Format Comparison

### **Before (Current Sprint)**
- **Sprint Focus** - Address and complete high-priority issues
- **Major Themes** - All planned stories remained incomplete  
- **Key Updates** - Team encountered significant blockers

### **After (Updated Current Sprint)**
- **Sprint Overview** - Briefly summarize the general nature of the work completed
- **Key Features & Deliverables** - List any feature work, enhancements, or user-facing changes that were completed
- **Success Criteria** - Summarize the key accomplishments and outcomes achieved
